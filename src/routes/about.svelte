      <em>The Air on Earth</em>
      is a musical project by Nick Ball. The project attempts a wide range of
      genres with influences from artists like Explosions and the Sky, Sigur
      RÃ³s, Radiohead, Jon Hopkins, Bon Iver, and many more. Within minimal
      arrangments, ambience, and long songs you'll hear delayed guitars, drone-y
      synths, electronic drums, pianos, and found percussion sounds. The music
      will age with the person but the project will stay the same.
